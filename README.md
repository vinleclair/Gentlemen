# Gentlemen

A simple web app demo for a babershop.

# Usage

Visit https://barbier-gentlemen.herokuapp.com/

*Local setup soon*

# Decisions

* Use of MVC instead of MVVM since I'm more familiar with it
* Didn't use boilerplate because I wasn't familiar enough with the stack used
* Use static folder for images, ideally should be stored on something like AWS

# Known issues

* When booking additional appointments, the client details form name and email field show required error message before input is given.
